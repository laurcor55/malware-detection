# Data Science Take-home Assessment

Welcome and thanks for your application to the Certara AI team.  This take-home is designed to test general data science knowledge, basic python skills, and communication skills.  We often have feature requests from external and internal clients that require machine learning/deep learning.  Generally, one of the team members will work up a proof of concept that proves we can solve the problem in theory and present a plan of deployment.  Once at this stage, the team member will seek feedback from stakeholders and the rest of the Certara AI team.  In this take-home we have simulated this experience.  You have been given a dataset and some information about the needs of the client.  You should write this proof of concept in python.  Please ask any questions of the team at any time via email, and we’ll be happy to provide any information or insight we have.  The goal is not to measure how perfect your solution is, but to understand how you get to your solution. A successful solution will include scripts that allow us to reproduce your work – so a requirement.txt file will be helpful to reproduce your environment. 

Please time box the assignment to a maximum of 8 hours.  As part of the delivery of the assignment, please create a Github repo with your scripts, and requirements.txt file.  

## Task:
We’ve been contracted to set up an Android malware detection for a client.  And they actually have some historical data!  The client has shared out a dataset of instances where malware has been detected or not.  The features of the dataset represent permissions being present or not (0,1).  There are 86 features and then the label column (Result, also a binary label of 0,1)1.

The client wants a software solution that can be used to programmatically identify cases of malware infection.  

Your task as the data scientist assigned to produce a POC (proof of concept) is three-fold.  

1. Firstly, you should perform some exploratory data analysis on the data to make sure it is suitable to be used as input to a machine learning model.  

Prepare some EDA for dataset and present it in a notebook (Jupyter) or your preferred method.  
You should be able to walk us through your code and your thought process in analyzing the data and point out any potential pitfalls that we may want to be aware of when training/evaluating the model.


2. Secondly, you should attempt to train a series of machine learning models to attempt to predict Result by using the feature set given. 
Once you are familiar with the dataset you should attempt to apply machine learning approaches to predict Result, given the other features.  You may present this in a notebook (Jupyter) or your preferred method.  Be prepared to discuss model selection, model evaluation (what metrics did you use and why?), feature selection, and why you chose the final method you settle on.  



3. Thirdly you should consider how the final model will be served to the client.
There is no code output required for this section – but given the method you decided upon in step 2, how would you deploy this to the client?  What would be some concerns?  Is it scalable?  What would be some questions you have for the client at this point in the project to ensure that the deliverable is not only useful in theory but also in practice.
